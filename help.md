Usage: miditoyz stream [OPTIONS]

  Stream music from a catalog song list, a midi file, or directory full of
  midi files to a midi device with using bank selection and program changes
  based on voice preferences stored in "~/.miditoyz/settings.json" and saved
  automatically each time you stream. Catalog song lists are JSON files with
  the format: [{"title": "Autumn Leaves", "song": "hash.mid"}, ...] and can be
  created from your collections "catalog.json". Bookmark values are based on
  the sequential number of the song in the playlist or directory song list
  starting with 1. We do the right thing if you specify a bookmark number
  that's too big or small or your play different music than last time. Your
  command line options are remembered between streaming sessions, so
  subsequent streamings pick up from the last song played.
