$ miditoyz stream --help
Usage: miditoyz stream [OPTIONS]

  Stream music from a catalog song list, a midi file, or directory full of
  midi files to a midi device with using bank selection and program changes
  based on voice preferences stored in "~/.miditoyz/settings.json" and saved
  automatically each time you stream. Catalog song lists are CSV files with a
  mandatory header of "title,id" -- don't forget to use comma to separate for
  CSV fields, and double-quote fields with commas in them. Create song lists
  using the "query" command.  Bookmark values are based on the sequential
  number of the song in the playlist or directory song list starting with 1.
  We do the right thing if you specify a bookmark number that's too big or
  small or your play different music than last time. Don't want to play your
  songs in order? Try the "shuffle" option. Your command line options are
  remembered between streaming sessions, so subsequent streamings pick up from
  the last song played.
